## Overview
This script calculates the difference between the current and desired values of stocks in a portfolio based on predefined portions.

To use the Etrade Stock Portfolio Rebalance Calculator, you need a CSV file containing your portfolio data (Generated by Etrade).

### CSV File Format
The CSV should be exported from Etrade platform from the specific portfolio.

### Running the Script
1. Save the script as `etrade-rebalancer.sh`.
2. Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x etrade-rebalancer.sh`.
3. Run the script with the CSV file, symbols, and portions as arguments:


`./etrade-rebalancer.sh path/to/your/portfolio.csv "symbol1 symbol2 ..." "portion1 portion2 ..."`

The script will output a table with the following columns:

- Symbol: The stock symbol.
- Current Value: The current value held for the stock.
- Desired Value (Portion %): The target value based on the desired portfolio distribution, along with the percentage of the total portfolio this represents.
